# Snake - Arcade
 - I'm going to be ~attempting~ to make snake, as I have done tic-tac-toe before and I would like to keep my sanity. 

 # Requirements 
- start the game by pressing a Start button

- use my arrow keys to change the direction of the snake

- have the snake grow correctly when it eats the apple

- have the game end if the snake tries to eat itself

- have the game end if the snake runs into a wall

- see how long my snake was when the game ended

- start the game over without having to reset the browser

# Nice-To-Haves
- can set the difficulty (speed of snake)

- can keep track of my stats (maximum points, average points, etc.) between games
