# Snake - Arcade
 - I'm going to be ~attempting~ to make snake, as I have done tic-tac-toe before and I would like to keep my sanity. 

 # Requirements 
- start the game by pressing a Start button
    Done!
- use my arrow keys to change the direction of the snake
    Done!

- have the snake grow correctly when it eats the apple
    Done!
- have the game end if the snake tries to eat itself
    Done!
- have the game end if the snake runs into a wall
    Done!

- see how long my snake was when the game ended
    Done! ?

- start the game over without having to reset the browser
    Done!

# Nice-To-Haves
- can set the difficulty (speed of snake)
    Done kind of. This starts at a set speed and increases as you eat more apples.

- can keep track of my stats (maximum points, average points, etc.) between games
    Done!
